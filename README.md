# RecipeConvertor
Transform an image of ingredients to ingredients in the metric system. (In grams)


### Why I did this? 
I Love to Bake! :cake:.

When I look at a new recipe I try to convert all the cups and tbsp to grams. (Its more accurate and even less dishes! :wink:) 

So every time I convert all the ingredients to grams and send to my "recipes" whatsapp group. 
Now I can do it automaticlly!! 



### What you need to run this program:
- Tesseract installed in computer and pytesseract imported to python (decodes the photo to string)
- csv2 imprted to python - used to read an img.
